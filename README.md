  <h1> Note of PINNs mainly composed by keras </h1>

<h2> A repository to stock my notes of PINNs and DDNNs on different differential equations, 
  as well as the comparisons between traditional simulation methods. Source that I used in coding is written in the .py files if there is one.</h2>

Note that some simulation data may be from Fortran
