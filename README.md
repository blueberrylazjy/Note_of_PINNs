  <h1> Note of PINNs mainly composed by keras </h1>

<h2> A repository to stock my notes of the use of PINNs and DDNNs on different differential equations, 
  and comparisons with traditional simulation method. Source that I used in coding is written in the .py files if there is one. feel free to ask me if there are any question about the code</h2>

Note that some simulation data may be from Fortran
