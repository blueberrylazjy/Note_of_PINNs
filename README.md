<h1> Note of PINNs mainly composed by keras</h1>

<h2> A repository to stock my notes of the use of PINNs and DDNNs and aswell different simulations on physics problems </h2>

<h2> Source is written in the .py files if there are one, feel free to ask me if there are any questions about the codes</h2>

Note that some simulation data may be from Fortran
